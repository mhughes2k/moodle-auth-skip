Moodle Skip Authentication Plugin
=================================

This authentication plugin allows you set up a user that you will 
be logged in as, without need to specify a user name or password.

This is created for use by developers who may have to switch between
different accounts frequently whilst developing, and saves them the
hassle of having to interactively log in each time.

How to Use
----------

You need to create a user named 'su' and then add them as a site 
administrator (or whatever role you want them to start from) to make this work.
